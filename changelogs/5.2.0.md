# Changes & Fixes
* Added support for basic selectors (@s & @r) for commands requesting players or other entities
  * These selectors are basic in nature, and do not presently support advanced filters
* Command parsing on player names now ignores casing
* Updated internal command framework to the newest Cloud 2.0 beta builds

## Economy
* Changed how a currency accepts its formatting, now opting for a set of MiniMessage-based templates versus assumed formatting
  * This acts as an API break
* Updated the config format for currency description to support the new formatting system. Please see the example config on [Github](https://github.com/NickImpact/Impactor/blob/1.20.1/impactor/src/main/resources/impactor/assets/configs/economy.conf#L49-L64) to understand how to update your configs for this change!
