# | These settings control how the Impactor economy service, when used as the driver of a        |
# | platform's economy, functions. By design, the Impactor economy service is meant to delegate  |
# | and mirror the current service running on a platform where a typical global service is       |
# | normally available. However, it can still be the chosen service where available, allowing    |
# | the plugin to take over and control economy related actions.                                 |
# |                                                                                              |
# | TLDR: These settings will only apply if Impactor is the controlling economy service!         |

# How the service should store data
#
# - The various options are explained in more detail on the LuckPerms wiki:
#   https://luckperms.net/wiki/Storage-types
#
# - Possible options:
#
#   |  Remote databases - require connection information to be configured below
#   |=> MySQL
#   |=> MariaDB (preferred over MySQL)
#   |=> PostgreSQL
#
#   |  Local databases - Databases which exist only locally
#   |=> H2 (Default)
#
#   |  Readable & editable text files - don't require any extra configuration
#   |=> JSON (.json files)
#   |=> HOCON (.hocon)
#   |=> YAML (.yaml)
#
# - The JSON flatfile provider is the default option.
