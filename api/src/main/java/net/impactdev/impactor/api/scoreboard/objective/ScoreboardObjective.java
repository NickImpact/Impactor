/**
 * Represents the objective of a Scoreboard. Effectively, for display-based scoreboards,
 * this objective acts as the title to the scoreboard. Impactor provides 4 different types of
 * objectives, which all provide different means of updating. The following types available are:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link ConstantObjective Constant}</li>
 *     <li>{@link RefreshingObjective Refreshing}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ListeningObjective Listening}</li>
 *     <li>{@link AnimatedObjective Animated}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * In order to create any particular instance of these, you'll want to go through
 * this class. So, {@link ScoreboardObjective#constant()} will construct a builder
 * specific to creating a constant based objective.
