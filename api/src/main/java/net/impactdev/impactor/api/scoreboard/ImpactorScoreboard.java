/**
 * Represents a scoreboard that appears on the side of a user's screen. This scoreboard is built amongst
 * a set of {@link ScoreboardLine lines} as well as an {@link ScoreboardObjective objective} (title).
 * The scoreboard implementations feature non-flicker variants with placeholder parsing support, alongside
 * full support for hex color codes.
 *
 * <p>As a means of efficiency as well as convenience, the objective and each line can have their own
 * means of updating, as well as how they update. For instance, you can have a line that features
 * no updating whatsoever, to save resources for ticking a line that otherwise would never change.
 * Additionally, outside running animations and lines that refresh their contents based on a schedule,
 * the API allows for updating based on event occurrences. For example, imagine a scoreboard with the
 * following creation design (excuse formatting, 80 character limits are fun):
 *
 * <p>
 * <h2>Creating a Scoreboard</h2>
 * To create a scoreboard, you'll want to look at {@link ScoreboardLine}, {@link ScoreboardObjective},
 * and {@link ScoreboardFrame}. These three components provide the means of accessing the many types of
 * line components provided by the Impactor API. This rule of thumb only applies to using the Impactor
 * specific providers. Third-party providers can be constructed as valid components where fit.
 *
 * <p>Below, you can find an example for how to create a scoreboard with this API:
 * <pre>
 * private final ImpactorScoreboard&lt;ServerPlayer&gt; scoreboard = ImpactorScoreboard.&lt;ServerPlayer&gt;builder()
 *             .objective(ScoreboardObjective.constant()
 *                  .text(Component.text("Impactor Scoreboard Demo")
 *                      .color(TextColor.color(255, 215, 0))
 *                  )
 *                  .build()
 *              )
 *             .line(ScoreboardLine.refreshing()
 *                  .text(StringUtils.repeat("\u25A0", 30))
 *                  .rate(1)
 *                  .effects(RGBFadeEffect.builder()
 *                      .frames(90)
 *                      .step(3)
 *                      .start(0)
 *                      .build()
 *                  )
 *                  .async()
 *                  .build(), 15
 *             )
 *             .build()
 * </pre>
 * The following code will create a scoreboard with an objective title, which remains static throughout
 * the scoreboard's lifetime, with the text: Impactor Scoreboard Demo, with a Yellow Gold color. Then,
 * the only line of this example demonstrates a line which refreshes asynchronously, at a rate of 1 tick,
 * with a line that is simply a set of 30 squares. These squares are then run through an RGB fade effect
 * which runs through the visible color spectrum, with each square being a unique color in the set. The
 * line will also be assigned a score of 15, per the integer specified as the second argument to line().
 *
 * <p>Note that the scoreboard is generic, and that's to allow for specification of the type of player that
 * this scoreboard can be assigned to for a particular platform. In this case, the example makes use of
 * ServerPlayer, provided by Sponge API 8.
 *
 * <p>
 * <h2>Assigning a Scoreboard to a Player</h2>
 * To assign a scoreboard to a particular player, you'll want to make use of {@link #assignTo(Object)},
 * where the provided object is the instance of the player that will be viewing that scoreboard.
 *
 * <p>Once assigned, that scoreboard, unless otherwise specified, will be reflective upon them for player
 * specific placeholders. Additionally, this will produce a copy of this scoreboard, so it's expected
 * the user of the API will track scoreboard instances via some form of cache, whether that be just a
 * maintained {@link Map}, or even a cache from Caffeine.
 *
 * <p>
 * <h2>Placeholder Parsing</h2>
 * Most components of the scoreboard API allows for placeholder sources to be provided for possible
 * placeholder parsing. These sources are provided through the {@link PlaceholderSources} interface,
 * which allows for binding a class type with a supplier for the actual object. For all components,
 * the scoreboard will attempt to provide a source representing the viewing player, as long as no
 * currently provided player is already available for that line. So, you can have a line on a scoreboard
 * focus on a player other than the viewer themselves.
